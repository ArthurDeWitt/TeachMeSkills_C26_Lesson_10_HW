There is a client.
The client can have any number of cards.
A card has three fields - cvv code, card number and amount on the card.
Display a message about how many identical cards the client has.
The field describing the amount on the card should not participate in the comparison.
That is, two cards with the same cvv codes and numbers but different amounts are considered the same.
Provide different variants of the output message - 
for example, the client has no cards, the client has no identical cards and other possible situations.
